\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We can extract and reconstruct forensically relevant Tor browser
information from memory dumps. Although the data recovered is
incomplete, it is still forensically sound, since we extract most of
the HTML, and therefore most of a website's core content. The
extraction process can be facilitated using our Python
tool~\ref{sec:appendix}. Future work would be to extend the tool to
produce more complete representations of what a suspect was looking
at. It would also be interesting to create a script that automates the
use of tools so that extraction of these artifacts can be done faster
and easier.
