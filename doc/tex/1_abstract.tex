\section*{Abstract}
People are becoming more aware of their privacy online and try to
protect this using specialized software. These programs which hide
your online identity are sometimes being abused for illigal
activities. The Tor web browser is such a software which enables
anonymous online communication and protects against adversaries on the
network whilst leaving no trace of artifacts on the hard drive. This
research is focused on analyzing and extracting artifacts from memory
dumps precisely for this reason. In this paper we present how to
extract relevant forensic artifacts of the Tor browser from memory
dumps in an automated fashion with potential for future work.
